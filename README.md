  Bypass cloudfare security WAF and show cloudfare status with lucifer ðŸ‘¿ ðŸ‘¿




  Lucifer is an HTTP Flooding Tool 





  That can Bypass Cloudfare security firewall and can also show cloudfare status





  If CFUAM is not enabled



  It uses four types of proxies namely: http, https, socks4 and socks5 proxy.....




  Even though this tool may bypass cloudfare firewall but not all cloudfare WAF





  It cant bypass all cloudfare WAF




  
  As it can only bypass if CFUAM is not enabled





  Cloudfare firewall security is a very secured and damn too powerful


 


  To resist any types of DDOS by shielding the host ip address with the





  Cloudfare proxy chain ip address
  
  
  
  
  
  This tool uses Cfscrape module to create scraper to bypass the anti-bot mecahnism shield
   
   
  
   
   
  But is still not that effeicient due to the strict accurate security measures 


 


  Especially in the cloudfare waiting room...........
